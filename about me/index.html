  <p>Hi how are you my name is Joel Shayne molai.Iam studying web fundamentals with the goal of opening an It shop which helps people one day.
    I live in south africa but iam from Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>What l love most about Byu idaho is that it teaches you how to include God in your studies
        and also how to make time for school.The advantages of studying this course is that l hope to be an independent person to proove myself that l can do anythng with God and also hard work.I have been a member of the church for 21 years now and my favourite scripture is 
        James 1 vs 5 "if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God". </p>
